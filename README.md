# movies-etl

## Overview

This challenge involves creating an automated pipeline from data to transform it and load it into tables. Extract, transform, and load. This challenge had us reusing and refactoring code from the module assignments and then creating one function out of that code. This would take Wiki data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data along the extract, transform, and load process to then add onto a PostgreSQL database, which we checked the output with pgAdmin. 

This challenge required creating 4 deliverables:
- Write an ETL Function Read Three Data Files
- Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
- Create the Movie Database
